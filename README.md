# myfirstwebsite

A basic HTML, JS &amp; CSS website.

This website was created following a tutorial provided by Andrei Neagoie at udemy.com.
The CSS, HTML, and Javascript was provided for me. It was then adjusted to display my own information.
The server.py file was written following the tutorial.
In the next coming months, I will be developing my own website by writing my own CSS, HTML, Javascript, and Python code.
